# rpolecat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rpolecat is to make downloading and working with the [POLECAT event data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/POLECAT) easier. 

The POLECAT data are provided via two repositories on dataverse:

- [POLECAT Weekly Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AJGVIT), containing the actual data files. 
- [POLECAT Documentation](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LMFPIP)

## Installation

You can install the development version of rpolecat like so:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("basil-analytics/rpolecat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rpolecat)

data(contexts)
head(contexts)

data(modes)
head(modes)
```

To download the data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# (not run)

# to donwload all data
download_polecat(local_dir = "foo/foo")

# to download only some years
download_polecat(local_dir = "foo/foo", years = c(2021:2023))
```
